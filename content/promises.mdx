Have you ever felt lost in the world of promises, callbacks, and asynchronous JavaScript functions as a beginner web developer? I certainly did. In my four years of navigating the complex landscape of web development, I discovered a common pitfall in the way these concepts are often taught â€“ not from a beginner's perspective.

Many tutorials dive straight into creating promises, discussing pending, resolved, and rejected states, without considering the viewpoint of someone just starting their coding journey. It left me wondering, "What is this? Why am I creating promises when I haven't even used them in my projects?"

For a long time, I found myself skipping through the creation of promises and delving directly into handling them. In fact, after three years, I hadn't even bothered to learn the syntax of promises because, as a beginner, I didn't see the immediate need.

The turning point came when I started working on more advanced projects. Suddenly, the pieces started falling into place. I grasped the essence of promises not through formal learning, but organically, as a byproduct of my evolving understanding of JavaScript.

**My advice to fellow beginners is simple**: don't get discouraged if the concept of promises seems elusive at first. Instead of obsessing over creating promises, focus on handling them. It's okay not to fully understand the intricacies of promises as a beginner; the comprehension will naturally follow as you gain more experience.

As you navigate through the world of web development, remember that learning is a journey. Embrace the process, and don't be afraid to prioritize what makes sense for your current level of expertise. Promises will reveal themselves to you in due time, and when they do, you'll appreciate the depth and power they bring to your coding endeavors.
